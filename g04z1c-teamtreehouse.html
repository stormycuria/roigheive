So I just signed up for the free trial with TeamTreehouse, and looking to do the Full Stack Javascript Track. I want to do web-applications for full stack services, and eventually start my own businesses through the use of those web-applications. But I was looking through the course and it seems like there is some missing parts? Like they only cover ES5, and not ES6, or ES2017? Should I be concerned? And then my additional questions are, for those individuals who have completed the course/track. teamtreehouse.com / Mat Helme Illustrator Foundations 2018, ENG скачать торрент бесплатно без регистрации.

I am a Math major with a comp sci minor. I started a career in IT which I love, but its largely been void of programming(if anything just powershell and cmd scripts, im more of a sysadmin). Recently we have gone full steam ahead with office365 and sharepoint. Forward thinking there are some wants from people in the company that require more than a sysadmin's duties of deploying and managing services.

First off, apologies if this is the wrong arena but it felt like a good place to start. At my company we're trying to build a training plan for graduate / new developers, and it's fallen to me to build up a set of resources for frontend tech. As I learnt the basics a decade or so ago I'm not really sure where to start now, but I still want to start in roughly the same place: HTML Semantics the and sections and what goes where ("anatomy of a webpage") Basic. 
im quite surprised that i didn't find this already posted in this sub,but anyway, do you know anything that can teach me C# programming easily? like a book or a youtube channel. I graduated with a BA from a great university back in January but. A BA was never my plan. I know it sounds dumb, a degree is a degree, but I really wanted that BS(and I dont feel like a grad school would take me jumping from Arts to Science). If I could go back and slap my 19 year old self I would. But here I am at 25, with the opportunity to go back to school (while working, but its flexible hours). So I'm going to do it! I heavily toyed with the idea of a certificate from a community. I don't want to say I have any bit of experience in programming, but I think I'm beginning to grasp the fundamentals. A lot of the courses I've taken (YDKJS, LPTHW, Udacity Intro to CS, Upskill, Treehouse, even Code Academy) are formatted essentially the same way, teaching you syntax and variable assignment, arrays, loops, etc. and then usually wrapping up the course with a mini project where you code a search engine or build a web app. Something tells me that's not how a junior developer. 
Hi all, I’m moving to Prague to teach English in July and I want to learn to code while there. Im current doing Freecodeacademy but can’t seem to find any part time boot camps there. Does anyone have any suggestions on an online course to follow in my free time while I’m there? Or should I forgo teaching and do a bootcamp there? Thanks. I'm just comparing those 2 sites if you have experience with any of them please included , I'm aware of other sites `lynda` , `pluralsight` , `udemy`.

Thought some locals would find this useful. Lynda offers professional video tutorials on just about everything. Normally /month Treehouse offers video tutorials on coding and design. Normally /month Personally I'm using Lynda to improve my photography, and Treehouse to learn a new programming framework You can find the links on the library district's Life Long Learning page ( It's also super Hi guys, I have completed the C# Track and also made a few projects to learn that things. I made a blackjack card game and a webscaper that uses the google translate api to translate text in the console. So after hours of practicing I want to also visualize my apps. For example rebuild the black jack games but this time with actual cards and a board etc. What course or material should I do next to learn GUI's? I'm especially interested in making small games but if possible without using. I have learned some solid basics in html, css, javascript, and can put some nice basic websites together. Im looking to advance towards a professional level front-end web developer over the next few months, and was thinking about signing up for teamtreehouse.com or a similar online course service. Do you guys have any advice for me where I'm at? Are these online services worth paying for? Is teamtreehouse good, or are there better services you guys can recommend? Thanks.
